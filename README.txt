 *README for Personal Cavern Augmented Projection
 */

 Personal Cavern is an augmented projection artwork examining the relationship
 between the architecture of a creation space and the creator within. This
 projection was shown above my head as I sat at my work desk underneath my bed.
 The cave forms around me as I create artwork--a reference to the holiness of 
 caves as the birth place of artwork.

 Personal Cavern was made in Processing 2.1 using minim, Box 2D, and
 Keystone p5.
